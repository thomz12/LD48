# LD48
Our Ludum Dare 48 game: Debt Collector

## Info
Made using my Juicebox game engine. The game can be played here: https://thomz12.github.io/DebtCollector/. The Ludum Dare page can be found here: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/debt-collector

## Building
Building should be very easy. In the Source/ folder, run the following command:
```
dotnet build
```
This should install the Nuget packages, compiler and kick of a build. Building can also be done from Visual Studio 2019. In the output directory there should be a `h5` folder containing all required resources to play the game. You can host a local webserver from this folder to test.
