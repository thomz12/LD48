Our Ludum Dare 48 game: Debt Collector ðŸ’° Play here! https://thomz12.github.io/DebtCollector/

## Info
Made using my Juicebox game engine. The Ludum Dare page can be found here: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/debt-collector

> In DEBT COLLECTOR ðŸ’° the goal is to collect as much debt as possible before running out of time. Spend money on random items and add a dollar to your debt by pressing the SHOP-button over and over again. Or, to increase your debt even quicker, take out some subscriptions and loans that will automatically increase your debt every second ðŸ“ˆ! Will you be the best debt collector and up up with the deepest/highest debt before your credit card gets blocked? Try it out and see where you end up on our leaderboard! Will you take a top spot? ðŸ‘€

## Building
Building should be very easy. In the `Source/` folder, run the following command:
```
dotnet build
```
This should install the Nuget packages, compiler and kick of a build. Building can also be done from Visual Studio 2019. In the output directory there should be a `h5` folder containing all required resources to play the game. You can host a local webserver from this folder to test.
